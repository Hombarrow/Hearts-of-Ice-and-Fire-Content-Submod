 POLITICS_NED_STARK_DESC:0 "Eddard was born at Winterfell as the second son of Lord Rickard Stark and Lady Lyarra Stark. He had one older brother, Brandon, and two younger siblings, Lyanna and Benjen.\nEddard was fostered by Lord Jon Arryn at the Eyrie from the age of eight. There, Eddard befriended his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon, while Lord Jon became like a second father to him.\nIt was during the tourney at Harrenhal that Eddard saw Prince Rhaegar Targaryen crown Lyanna as the queen of love and beauty. Eddard would remember this moment as "the moment when all smiles died".\nThe following year, Eddard's sister Lyanna was abducted by Prince Rhaegar. Brandon rode to King's Landing in anger, but he was arrested when he threatened the crown prince. Lord Rickard Stark was summoned to King's Landing to answer for the crimes of his son, and rode to the capital with two hundred men. Both he and Brandon were executed at the command of King Aerys II Targaryen. Aerys's next step was to demand that Jon Arryn send him the heads of his former wards, Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and instead called his banners.\nEddard called his banners, and marched south to join Robert's Rebellion, arriving with Lord Hoster Tully in time to turn the tide at the Battle of the Bells. Afterward, he went to Riverrun to marry Hoster's elder daughter, Catelyn.\nUnfortunately, when Eddard found Lyanna, she was already dying. Before her death, she made Eddard promise her something. The experience haunts him to this day."
 

POLITICS_LORD_TYWIN_DESC:0 "Tywin was the first born son of Tytos Lannister and Jeyne Marbrand. While serving in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, he learned that House Lannister's reputation had sunk due to his father's weak-willed actions. Upon his return, Tywin demanded the repayment of all the gold his father had lent out. Lord Reyne reportedly laughed when he read Tywin's edicts and Lord Tarbeck acted in a similar manner. Tywin took command of the Lannister forces and crushed both vassal houses with ruthless efficiency. His destruction of House Reyne was so brutal that a song called 'The Rains of Castamere' was written as a tribute.\nYears later, Tywin was appointed Hand of the King by the newly-crowned King Aerys II Targaryen. After the death of his father, Tywin also became the Warden of the West. He married his cousin Joanna and she gave him twins, Cersei and Jaime. However, she died giving birth to Tyrion, considered a hideous monster.\nTywin proved himself as a brilliant Hand of the King and held the post for twenty years. Aerys' increasing paranoia and jealousy, however, drove the two into several bitter disagreements. Tywin eventually resigned his position and returned to Casterly Rock. When Robert's Rebellion began, Tywin maintained neutrality until Robert Baratheon's victory at the Trident. He marched with his forces to King's Landing and his men proceeded to sack the city. Aerys was killed by Jaime Lannister before Tywin's forces arrived at the Red Keep.\nAfter the rebellion, Tywin returned to Casterly Rock, where he continued to serve as Warden of the West."
 

POLITICS_ROOSE_BOLTON_DESC:0 "Roose practices the abolished tradition of the first night, but he is discreet with his activities and amusements in order to avoid the attention and possible ire of the Wardens of the North, House Stark.\nOnce, while hunting along the Weeping Water, Roose raped a young miller's wife and hanged the miller. When the woman later presented a baby to Roose, he spared the bastard boy Ramsay because he had the same pale eyes as him.\nRoose fought at the Battle of the Trident during Robert's Rebellion and also helped suppress Greyjoy's Rebellion. However, a territorial dispute ruined his alliance with House Stark.\nRoose was married to Bethany Ryswell, with whom he had one son survive the cradle. Roose's children who did not survive the cradle were buried below the Dreadfort. He eventually became a widower when his wife Bethany died of a fever. His son also died after visiting his half brother, Ramsay. Maester Uthor blamed a bad belly, but Lord Bolton attributes his heir's death to poisoning by Ramsay. Having no other trueborn heirs, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort but is not believed to have acknowledged him."
 

POLITICS_JON_ARRYN_DESC:0 "Jon was the eldest son of Lord Jasper Arryn. He had a younger brother, Ronnel, and a sister, Alys. Jon served as a Keeper of the Gates until his father's death. Because he had no children, Jon fostered Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon as his wards at the Vale. As they grew, they became close companions and regarded Jon as a second father.\nJon's nephew, Elbert, was murdered by King Aerys II in 1914 and the Mad King also demanded that Jon execute Eddard and Robert. Jon refused and raised his banners in revolt. In order to gain Lord Hoster Tully for the rebels, Eddard and Jon agreed to marry Hoster's daughters, Catelyn and Lysa in a dual ceremony at Riverrun.\nWhen Robert Baratheon ascended to the Iron Throne, he appointed Jon as his Hand. Through diplomacy, he managed to make peace with Dorne. To strengthen Robert's hold on the throne, Jon also negotiated the king's marriage with Cersei Lannister. Robert had considered the assassinations of Viserys and Daenerys, the last two Targaryens, but Jon dissuaded the king from the idea.\nEven though Robert left him with much of the responsibility of running the Seven Kingdoms, Jon could not stop him from spending huge amounts of money on tournaments and feasts, thus putting the realm in serious debt.\nHis marriage to Lysa was loveless, her finding him too old. After three girls and two boys miscarried, Lysa gave Jon a sickly son and heir, Robyn Arryn."

His children with his wife Jyana are Meera and Jojen, and he is a close friend of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell.\nHowland grew up hunting, fishing, climbing trees, and learning the magic of the crannogmen. After he reached the age of majority, he sought additional knowledge. He paddled a small skin boat down the Green Fork, evaded the Twins at night, and visited the Isle of Faces in search of the green men. He stayed at the island all winter.\nHowland joined the northern host during Robert's Rebellion and was one of Lord Eddard Stark's staunch companions. After the Sack of King's Landing and the siege of Storm's End, he accompanied Ned Stark south to the Red Mountains in search of the abducted Lyanna Stark. Howland and Eddard were the only survivors of the battle at the tower of joy.
