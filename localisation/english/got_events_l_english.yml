They offer an engagement between their Princess Myrcella and our Prince Trystane in return for a non-aggression pact. Strangely (or not) their offer only provided some basic reasoning and there was no word of whether they regret the murder of Elia Martell and her children.\n\nHow should we respond?"
 

dorne.6.a:0 "Maybe the next generation will bring our houses together..."

dorne.6.b:0 "Demand justice for Elia and her children first."

[HOL.GetLeader] says that it's a shame that we need their allegiance, otherwise he would happily help them join Elia and her children.\n\nIn order to agree to a deal, [SPR.GetLeader] request that we arrest Ser Gregor Clegane and hand him over to face trial in Dorne. Naturally, handing over one of our most capable and loyal commanders would not be a good move, however, there might be another option: Ser Amory Lorch was also among the people who murdered Elia and her children and it will be very easy to put all the blame on him."
 

dorne.7.a:0 "Ser Gregor will have to pay for his crimes."

dorne.8.d:0 "It would appear that [HOL.GetLeader] does not wish to admit to the crimes of his trusty General Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane. Instead, he has arrested and sent over Ser Amory Lorch, the man that was said to have stabbed Elia's daughter over a dozen times with his sword. While his mutiliated body will certainly make good food for the homeless dogs outside the palace, we should not forget that the main culprit is The Mountain. Although... we could play along and make the Lannisters think that we are no longer interested in vengeance..."

Clearly the Lannisters feel that it is important that relations between us normalize and, as was our promise, we will also agree to a royal engagement between Prince Trystane and Princess Myrcella. The bigger question on everyone's minds, however, is what to do with the Mountain? Fortunately, our advisors have several ideas for that. We can:\n\n- Cut his head off and leave it as an ornament on [SPR.GetLeader]'s desk.\n\n- Paralyze him and bury him with 100 Red Scorpions. Not only will it be a callback to the old days but biologists claim that such a major source of food will help with the conservation efforts of the endangered Dornish Red Scorpion.\n\n- Arrest him and throw him in a cell. A zoo cell that is, where all beasts belong. He will spend the rest of his days having visitors laugh and throw food at him.\n\n- Or we can simply kill him in a, mostly, painless way and donate his body to the Anatomical Research Institute of Sunspear."

He revealed to them that the Alliance with [HOL.GetName] is only temporary and that [SPR.GetNameDef] will betray them, as Doran put it, 'when the time is right'.

stark.22.desc:0 "Due to recent events, we must accept the all too real possibility that [FIN.GetName] might not win this war. To ensure the survival of the Stark household, a proposition has been put forward to [FIN.GetLeader] to evacuate lower-ranking members of the Stark family to the island of Skaagos. With its geographic isolation, it would provide a safe haven for the heirs of Winterfell until we can, hopefully, turn this war around."
stark.22.a:0 "Begin the evacuation immediately!"
stark.22.b:0 "No deal. We will fight to the end."

vale.1.t:0 "Jon Arryn dies"
 

vale.1.d:0 "After a sudden and fierce fever, we are sad to report that Hand of the King Jon Arryn has passed away. The former Lord of the Eyrie was one of the great heroes of Robert's Rebellion and many are saddened by this event.\n\nWith Lord Arryn's demise, the title of Hand of the King will now pass on to another one of King Robert's allies and personal friend of Jon Arryn - Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell. Though he is equally respected by the people there are many, most notably the members of House Lannister, that do not approve of that decision. How this will affect the Crownlands remains to be seen.\n\nWhat we need to worry about is his heir. The Lord's son - Sweet Robyn Arryn. Not only is he not of age but he also has some... problems. Due to this, it will be best if we assign a regent to serve in his place as soon as possible."
 


vale.1.a:0 "Hail the new Warden of the East"






vale.2.t:0 "Sansa kissed Petyr!"
 


vale.2.d:0 "- She kissed him! The little whore kissed Petyr! -\n\nThose were lady Lysa's words when she grabbed Sansa Stark by the hair and threatened to toss her out the Moon Door. Luckily, Lord Petyr Baelish arrived just in time to spare us a diplomatic accident. He was even able to calm Lady Lysa down with the words...\n\n- I have only ever loved one woman... only one..."
 


vale.2.a:0 "Your sister..."

vale.2.b:0 "You, my dear!"






vale.3.t:0 "House Grafton objects to Wildlings in the Government"
 

vale.3.d:0 "Representatives from Gull Town have arrived at the capital in order to object to our recent decision to allow 'Wildlings' into prominent positions.\n\nThis almost led to a physical confrontation with one of the Hill Tribe leaders, present at the meeting. Though we were able to calm the two down, it seems like House Grafton will not be persuaded so easily."
 

vale.3.a:0 "They will have to deal with it."




vale.4.t:0 "House Grafton declare Independence!"
 

vale.4.d:0 "Citing recent events, as well as 'years of neglect' House Grafton has officially announced is cecession from [SWE.GetNameDef]. They ask that we immediately recognize their independence or be threatened by war."
 

vale.4.a:0 "Have they learned nothing from Robert's Rebellion?"


vale.4.b:0 "Good riddance."




vale.5.t:0 "Littlefinger arrested!"
 

vale.5.d:0 "Though he is now safely behind bars, he was still able to cause a ruckuss during the arrest and it won't be long before Lady Lysa finds out about this."
 

vale.5.a:0 "What is the worst she could do?"




vale.6.t:0 "Littlefinger released!"
 

vale.6.d:0 "By the personal orders of Lady Lysa Arryn, the guards were forced to release Lord Baelish from his cell. Not only that but she has announced that she plans to marry him, effectively making him the new Lord of the Eyrie.\n\nA lot of people seem to believe that he will not be happy with those who ordered the arrest."
 

vale.6.a:0 "We need to get rid of him!"




vale.7.t:0 "Evidence found!"
 

vale.7.d:0 "Thanks to our good friends - and some assist from a few faceless assasins - we were able to find enough evidence to incriminate Petyr Baelish for the death of Jon Arryn!"
 

vale.7.a:0 "We should confront lady Lysa immediately!"




vale.8.t:0 "Lady Lysa is dead!"
 
vale.8.d:0 "According to the only witness that was there - Sansa Stark - Lady Lysa felt very jealous of her niece and, despite Lord Baelish's attempts to calm her down, she decided to commit suicide by jumping out the Moon Door.\n\nThat is way too convenient and Littlefinger has already started persuading the young Robyn Arryn to his side. It seems like unless we act fast, we may find ourselves joining Lady Lysa, down the Moon Door."
 
vale.8.a:0 "Time is short..."




vale.9.t:0 "The Lords of the Vale are defiant!"
 

vale.9.d:0 "It seems as though there are still those who deny our claim to the Vale. So be it. We will crush them once and for all."
 

vale.9.a:0 "Charge!"



vale.10.t:0 "Yohn Royce is thrown down the Moon Door"
 
vale.10.d:0 "Our Lord, Sweet Robyn Arryn seemed especially happy and clapped with delight while watching 'the big fat man fly'."
 

vale.10.a:0 "When you play the game of thrones..."





vale.11.t:0 "The Lords of the Vale suspect something"
 

vale.11.d:0 "It would appear the a certain segment of the Vale Lords is misstrusting of our version of events. Most vocal of them is Yohn Royce, who has never hid his distain for Lord Baelish. We should probably do something about him before the old man actually convinces enough people to side against us."
 

vale.11.a:0 "Shouldn't be too difficult..."





vale.12.t:0 "Littlefinger put in a Sky Cell"
 

vale.12.d:0 "Yohn Royce watched with great delight as Lord Baelish was being taken to his new Sky Cell home. He even made sure to caution him not to roll around too much. Sweet Lord Robyn Arryn was a bit worried about the whereabouts of his Uncle Petyr, but he quickly got over it once Lord Royce gave him a new toy eagle to play with."
 

vale.12.a:0 "We shouldn't have trusted him..."





vale.13.t:0 "Yohn Royce and Petyr Baelish join forces... for now"
 
vale.13.d:0 "The Lord of Runestone has agreed to work with Lord Baelish for the better of the realm. After all, these are troubled times and we all need to stand together. Lady Sansa Stark was also very helpful in finalizing this deal, as her convincing testimony helped convince the Vale Lords of Lord Baelish's innocence."
 
vale.13.a:0 "We had nothing to worry about... Right?"





vale.14.t:0 "So many caches!"
 

vale.14.d:0 "While raiding the Hill Tribes' stockpiles, we discovered enough rifles to arm a whole division. True, most are slightly outdated but we can still use them. Alternatively, we can donate them to one of our allies."
 
vale.14.a:0 "Keep them to ourselves."


vale.14.b:0 "Donate them to [FIN.GetName]."

vale.14.c:0 "Donate them to [HOL.GetName]."

vale.14.e:0 "Donate them to [CAN.GetNameDef]."





vale.15.t:0 "Arms donation from [SWE.GetName]"
 
vale.15.d:0 "Having recently dealt with the Hill Tribes that were harassing their population, the Vale has uncovered huge caches of weapons that they don't really know what to do with. Thus, they have decided to donate them to our cause."
 
vale.15.a:0 "Send our thanks to [SWE.GetLeader]."





volantis.1.t:0 "There's something strange in the mud..."
 

volantis.1.d:0 "During an excavation in one of the new mines, one of our workers claims to have struck something 'very weird and scary'. At first he was laughed at, but then some of the other workers nearby started to also find some of those weird and scary things. We have since dispatched a team of engineers and archeologists to examine it."
 
volantis.1.a:0 "What could it be?"


volantis.2.t:0 "Dinosaur bones!"
 

volantis.2.d:0 "The weird and scary thing turned out to be a perfectly preserved dinosaur skeleton. Dinosaurs were ancient creatures that roamed the planet long ago, even predating the children of the forest. Not much is known about them, however the Maesters of Old Town have long expressed an interest in these fascinating creatures. This sample in particular is a brand new species that has some similarities to the dragons of Old Valyria. They scientists have decided to call it..."
 

volantis.2.a:0 "Tyranosaurus Rex!"




volantis.8.t:0 "Volantis offers us protection"
 

volantis.8.d:0 "Envoys from [POR.GetNameDef] have arrived in our capital, claiming that they offer us 'more security'. In reality, they are asking for us to lose our sovereignity and become a mere puppet of theirs. We have already detained those envoys and can send their heads back to their Masters.\n\nOur generals recommend we behead the one that keeps saying that our defiance is 'madness'."
 

volantis.8.a:0 "Having some security would be nice."
volantis.8.b:0 "Madness? THIS! IS! MANTARYS!"




volantis.9.t:0 "[ECU.GetName] accepts!"
 

volantis.9.d:0 "."
 

volantis.9.a:0 "Perfect!"




volantis.10.t:0 "[ECU.GetNameDef] is defiant!"
 

volantis.10.d:0 "Not only have they refused our demands but they even had the nerve to execute one of our envoys, returning only his head. They must be made to pay for this!"
 

volantis.10.a:0 "Let's go get them!"


volantis.10.b:0 "Maybe it's not worth it..."
