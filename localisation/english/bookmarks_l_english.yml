GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "A Game of Thrones"
 
GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since House Stark chose to isolate itself from the politics of King's Landing, House Lannister has positioned itself into a very comfortable position of power and many houses are feeling uneasy about this. Especially, The Dornish who have yet to forgive them the atrocities from Robert's Rebellion. Then, there is House Tyrell and the two younger Baratheon brothers, Renly and Stannis, who all seem to have their own agenda. Will King Robert Baratheon and Hand of the King Jon Arryn be able to maintain order in Westeros?"
 
HITTING_FAN_NAME:0 "The Hitting of the Fan"
 
HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "Yup, that's right! That umbrella collection is about to come in real handy."
 
ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Directly under the control of the King, King’s Landing and it’s holdings are considered to be a nest of vipers with its political games having far-reaching effects. Often it seems that Robert Baratheon is the only thing keeping the capital, and the country as a whole, together. Even with rumours of his eldest son’s parenthood circulating, it is vital that he remain on the throne if the Kingdom is to see peace..."
 
FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Riverlands saw the heaviest fighting of Robert's Rebellion and many of its green fields were turned into barren wastelands filled with blood and corpses. For almost twenty years House Tully has been attempting to recover, but the road ahead is still long and difficult. Should another war does come the Riverlands will likely find themselves caught in a vice between the other Houses. And whispers still continue of a dark conspiracy, as House Frey seeks to regain its independence…"
 
FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Stark was, and still is, one of Robert Baratheon’s closest ally, yet they were never able to overcome their differences with House Lannister over their actions during Robert's Rebellion. Their concerns persist to this very day.\n\nWhile more thinly populated than their size would suggest, the men and women of the North are some of the most resiliant and battle hardened soldiers of Westeros and they are ready to fight anyone who stands in their way."
 
SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For centuries the Bloody Gate has stood as a symbol of insurmountable defenses. Many armies have attempted to take it and they've all smashed themselves against its walls. The skilled warriors of the Vale have often stayed neutral in the wars of Westeros, relying on it’s walls to protect them. When Jon Arryn rebelled with Robert Baratheon, he proved that they could change history and as war once again seems inevitable, all wonder if the Vale will stay insular or chose to change Westeros once more..."
 
BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While Robert Baratheon become king, he has proven himself to be a drunken whoremonger, even if his influence is all that keeps the Kingdom in check. With dark rumors circulating in the Kingdom that Robert’s heirs may not be his own, many are looking to who the next king could be. Robert’s brother Renly has proven himself an effective ruler, beloved by the people, even if he is not next in line for the throne. Many are now willing to declare him the future king..."
 
HOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The richest House in Westeros has long enjoyed its a position of power. Their limited, but key, involvement in Robert's Rebellion was just a taste of what the armies of the Westerlands can do if need be.\n\nThough their armies were left untouched by the war and their oil reserves are seemingly limitless, their influence has come at the expense of a bitter rivalry with the House Stark and it seems that a new war is inevitable..."
 
ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ever since the failed Greyjoy Rebellion the Ironborn have not attempted to meddle in Westerosi affairs. That is all about to change however. Wether its under the leadership of Balon Greyjoy or another member of his family, this new generation of Ironborn is determined to see the old glory of the Iron Islands restored.\n\nBecause what is dead may never die."
IRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Of all of the Great Houses of Westeros, House Tyrell has never been a part of the royal family in any way, yet they are still considered one of the most powerful Houses. Controlling the country’s biggest food supply and the subsequent trade that stems from that, not to mention their population giving way to massive amounts of levies, whatever House Tyrell decides to do next will likely decide the fate of Westeros itself…"
 
SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The last Great House to join Westeros, House Martell has been deeply burned by the rest of the kingdom, due to the death and defilement of their beloved princess Elia Martell. Add to that the legions they lost fighting for The Mad King and they have long drifted apart from the rest of Westeros. Still, they remain a part of the realm and the world watches for their next move. Whether going for independence, or seeking to repair the injustices of the past, their actions in the days to come could change Westeros forever..."
 
GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "According to legend, the Others came from the Lands of Always Winter six or eight thousand years ago, and brought with them cold and darkness that lasted a generation: the Long Night. They resurrected dead men and animals to serve them until they were finally defeated in the Battle for the Dawn by the first men of the Night's Watch and the children of the forest.\n\nOver time their existence faded into legend and that has allowed their leader, the Night King, to amass a new army of the dead which might once again threaten Westeros."
 

VOL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Volantis is one of the oldest Free Cities. Decended from Old Valyria, it is now a Slaver state ruled by 'democraticly' elected triarchs. There are many whispers of a revolution, however, and should the slaves revol, can the old Triarchy survive?"
 

ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For centuries, House Bolton has been a loyal ally to House Stark. That all changed with the death of Lady Hornwood, and the refusal of Ned Stark to grant that land to Lord Bolton's bastard son, Ramsay.\n\nThe claim on Hornwood has haunted Bolton politics since the 1920s and, with tensions brewing in the world, the time has come to put an end to it. Whether through war or diplomacy, House Bolton will never be humiliated again!"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Empire of Japan stands at a crossroads. Hokushin-ron, the Northern Expansion Doctrine, is favored by the Army and calls for an advance into Siberia. Nanshin-ron, the Southern Expansion Doctrine, is supported by the Navy and has the rich European colonies in Southeast Asia and the Pacific as its target. \n\nAnd then, of course, there is always China. Japan possesses a formidable military, but its industries are starving for resources and time is running out. Which path to choose?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "By the end of Robert's Rebellion House Targaryen had been nearly wiped out, safe for young Viserys Targaryen and his sister Daenerys who have since been living in exile in Essos. Yet, the Last Dragon has not forgotten his birthright.\n\nNow an adult, Viserys has struck a deal with a Dothraki horselord, Khal Drogo, to bring his forces back to Westeros and take back the crown that is rightfully his. The only price he needs to pay is his sister..."
 
USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The United States retreated back into isolation at the end of the last war and enjoyed a period of economic prosperity during the Roaring Twenties. This came to a dramatic end when the nation was gripped by the Great Depression.\n\nAmerica's policy of non-intervention in foreign wars has stood firm, but tensions are rising in both Europe and Asia. The 'Great Neutral' may find itself drawn into the maelstrom whether it wants to or not."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 
CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Night's Watch was once a proud order of knights, sworn to protect Westeros from the Wildlings to the North. However after centuries of guarding The Wall, the order has seen a slow and steady decline. \n\nCrippled by an economic and military depression, the once proud order now seeks to regain its past glory by any means necessary."
 
AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 
HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While his elder brother became King of Westeros and his younger brother ruled over the Stormlands, Stannis Baratheon chose exile on the former Targaryen home island of Dragonstone. This has led many people to wonder what his true intentions are.\n\nThough it has not been confirmed, there have been some strong rumors that Lord Stannis is being advised by a mysterious Red Priestess from Asshai..."
RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 
BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "A Feast for Crows (Experimental Only)"
 
BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some major events break out in Westeros. King Joffrey now has complete control over the realm, supported by the Lannisters and the Tyrells. Roose Bolton has been declared Warden of the North and is keeping the other houses under control with an iron fist. With the Stark family fleeing to Skaagos the only glimmer of resistance comes from the remaining Tully rebels in the Riverlands. Whatever happens next will surely be bad news for the rest of Westeros."
 
ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After Ned Stark's failed coup and Stannis Baratheon's failed siege of the capital, King Joffrey Baratheon has now fully secured his position as Protector of the Realm and no rumours about his heritage may question that.\n\nNot everything is fixed however and there are still plenty of contenders who seek to take the crown for themseves."
 
FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The War of Five Kings left another trail of destruction in the Riverlands. Walder Frey's betrayal at the Red Wedding left the Tullies without their strongest allies and only Riverrun remains.\n\n Can the remaining Lords of the Riverlands survive?"

 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 
ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Thanks to their contribution in the War of Five Kings House Bolton has once more emerged as the dominant force in the North, even managing to secure the old Stark capital of Winterfell. \n\nNot all Northeners are willing to accept their new overlords however and it seems like only a matter of time before another faction arises to challenge the new Warden of the North."
 
SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "\n\n."
 
USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."

CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "A new dawn for the Night's Watch has arisen with Jon Snow as the new Lord Commander. Not everything is fine however, for Mance Rayder's Wildlings continue to amass and would soon be able to storm the Wall.\n\nCan the brothers of the Night's Watch survive?"
 
AST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"

ROM_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After refusing Robb Stark's alliance proposal the Greyjoys attacked the largely undefended North and seized much of its Western shore.\n\nWith the Starks gone however, the North is now under the control of the ruthless Boltons and the Ironborn must do everything in their power to hold on to their gains or risk being driven back into the Sunset Sea."

HUN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Despite failing to capture King's Landing, Stannis Baratheon still managed to secure the western coast of the Stormlands before the Tyrells could occupy it. In terms of army experience, the Lord of Dragonstone now has the most battle-hardened army in Westeros.\n\nWith seemingly no allies left, Stannis Baratheon must now seek alternative methods to seize the crown. Wether by uniting the North or by besieging King's Landing for a second time, only time will tell."
SPR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "While Westeros was engulfed in the War of Five Kings the Principality of Dorne opted to remain neutral. Yet now, with their enemies exhausted, the world wonders what the Dornishmen plan to do next. Especially now that they have custory over Princess Myrcella Baratheon."
