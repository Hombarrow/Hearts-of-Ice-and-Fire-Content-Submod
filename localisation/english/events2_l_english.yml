They were gathered around the Wall, a 700 foot tall and 300 mile long ice barrier which separates the lands of the north.\n\nThose days are long gone however. In recent decades the institution has fallen into disrepute and is largely ignored by the throne. It is severely undermanned and dwindling numbers have led to all but three of the Wall's nineteen castles being abandoned. The Wall, one of the natural wonders of the world has long since melted away and left only two large lakes in his place.\n\nYet, there is still hope. The Night's Watch is sworn to not get involved into the affairs of the Seven Kingdoms, ensuring it's neutrality in Robert's Rebellion and beyond. And with the Wildlings beyond the wall uniting under a new King, it just may be time for the proud Order to rise up once again."

gotintro.3.t:0 "House Stark of Winterfell"
 
gotintro.3.d:0 "House Stark is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Long before the Targaryen conquest the leaders of House Stark held the title of Kings in the North. That changed however when King Torren Stark bended the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and they would not regain that title until the end of Robert's Rebellion.\n\nThat war began when Princess Lyanna Stark was kidnapped by Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen in 1914. Then Lord Rickard Stark and his son Brandon both demanded her return, but were were executed by the Mad King King Aerys II Targaryen instead. Eddard Stark became the head of the family and with the support of House Baratheon, Tully and Arryn overthrew the Targaryen king. During the civil war Stark troops were instrumental in several engagements and it was Eddard Stark's forces that reached King's Landing just after the Lannisters had sacked it, ensuring the city was turned over to Robert's army when it arrived.\n\nDue to the North's vast size, gathering the full military strength of the Starks and their vassals is a difficult process, hence why some of their loyal bannermen like House Karstark and House Mormont have remained independent for all these years. House Bolton was also a Stark vassal once, but their failed invasion of Hornwood in the 1920s led to a bitter dispute between the two houses. House Stark does have a major ally in the Crownlands, specifically King Robert I Baratheon who, along with Ned Stark, kicked off Robert's Rebellion and though they have been somewhat enstranged from one another in recent years they remain friends to this very day.\n\nHouse Stark is one of the few noble Houses whose family motto is not a boast or threat. Instead, their motto is a warning, one that, no matter the circumstances, will always be relevant..."

gotintro.4.d:0 "No one quite knows the true origins of House Lannister, though most agree that its lineage begins with the legendary figure Lann the Clever, who tricked the Casterlys into abandoning their ancestral seat in Casterly Rock and taking it for himself. After that his lands would eventually grow to become the Kingdom of the Rock. The Lannisters woulld continue to rule the Westerlands until Aegon's Conquest when King Loreon I Lannister submitted to the Targaryens after his defeat at the Field of Fire.\n\nFor centuries the Lannisters were loyal to House Targaryen, but their fortunes truly changed for the better once Tywin Lannister became Warden of the West. He brutally crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion and was later appointed Hand of the King to 'Mad King' Aeris II. A wedge soon came between them though and after a fierce argument with the King, Tywin returned to Casterly Rock in 1913. This couldn't have come at a worse time as Robert's Rebellion broke out the following year and the forces of the Westerlands stayed neutral for almost the entire war.\n\nIn 1917 the forces of House Lannister appeared before the gates of King's Landing, claiming to have joined the war on the side of the King. That was a lie and the capital was sacked by the forces of the Westerlands. The royal family was brutally murdered by Sir Gregor Clegane and the Mad King was killed by his own Kingsguard, Tywin's son - Jaime Lannister. Since then House Lannister has been a loyal ally of the crown; new King Robert Baratheon even marrying Tywin's daughter Cersei.\n\nNot everyone was happy with the actions of House Lannister though, most notably the Starks of Winterfell, but there was nothing they could do about it. The Westerlands is the richest region in all of Westeros, with great mountains and hills serving as a natural defensive line and arguably the largest army on the continent.

It joined the Seven Kingdoms through peaceful marriage alliance nearly two centuries later. As a result of joining through marriage and not conquest, Dorne was allowed to keep many of its local customs and laws, such as equal inheritance laws for male and female heirs.\n\nWhen Robert's Rebellion broke out in 1914 the Dornish princess Elia Martell was married to the heir of the Iron Throne - Rhaegar Targaryen. Rheagar had dissapeared shortly before the rebellion with a Northern noblewoman and this was considered the start of the war. Even though Prince Doran Martell was furious about the way his sister had been treated he still agreed to aid to the Targaryens, convinced that Elia, as the wife to the crown prince, would one day become queen, and that her son Aegon would also be king.\n\nPrince Rhaegar was kiled at the Battle of the Trident (1918), as was Doran's uncle, Lewyn Martell who commanded the Dornish armies in the field. Mad King Aerys Targaryen was convinced that Lewyn had betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident and thus refused to send Elia and her children to Dragonstone alongside his own wife and new heir. Not long after, during the Sack of King's Landing, Elia and her children were brutally murdered by Lannister soldiers. Even after the war ended, Doran's younger brother Oberyn attempted to raise a rebellion for Viserys Targaryen in 1920, but that situation was sorted out after sucessful negotiations with the new Hand of the King Jon Arryn.\n\nSince then the Dornish have lived in relative isolation from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, but they have not forgotten what happened during that rebellion and it may only be a matter of time before the proud Dornish once more rise up to fight.

Though they managed to inflict the only loss Robert suffered during the war, at the Battle of Ashford (1916), the Targaryens were defeated and the Tyrells had to swear fealthy to the new King Robert I Baratheon.\n\nToday House Tyrell is a stable and honestly loving family, with none of the internal rivalries that are to be found in House Lannister or House Baratheon.

For one hundred years they remained on the island fortress of Dragonstone, until the rise of Aegon the Conqueror who, instead of reclaiming his ancestral land, chose to sail west for the Seven Kingdoms. While his host was relatively small, in comparison to the armies of Westeros, Aegon and his sister wives had a secret weapon: the last of the dragons. Eventually, all of the Seven Kingdoms bowed down to him; the weapons of his enemies were melted down by his dragon, Balerion the Black Dread, to forge the Iron Throne.\n\nFor 300 years the Targaryen dynasty stood strong in the face of rebellion, civil war and plague. But the dragons eventually died off and then came Robert's Rebellion (1914). The line of dragon kings was broken in 1918 when Aeris II, also known as the Mad King, was betrayed and murdered by a member of his own kingsguard: Ser Jaime Lannister. The capital of King's Landing was brutally sacked by the forces of Ser Jaime's father - Tywin Lannister.\n\nAeris's son and heir, Prince Rheagar Targaryen, perished on the field of battle at the hands of Robert Baratheon. The usurper, with the support of his other allies the Starks, Tullies and Arryn, claimed the Iron Throne for himself and became King Robert I. Rhaegar's wife and children were butchered by the Lannister forces and the only Targaryen children that managed to escape were prince Viserys Targaryen and his sister Daenerys. The two were evacuated by loyalists to the Free Cities of Essos where they have lived in exile ever since.\n\nNow, those children are all grown up and they are dreaming of a day when they will cross the Narrow Sea and take back what is rightfully theirs.
